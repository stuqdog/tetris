This is a working implementation of Tetris, with all central rules in play, written entirely in C. 
It uses the Allego game programming library (www.liballeg.org) for managing graphics and player
input. 

The core rules of the game are there, but it is lacking many of the modern updates (a hold option,
e.g.) to the game. My goal here was not to reinvent the wheel, but rather to create a project that 
would force me to research and become comfortable with a new C library, while reinforcing fundamental 
C concepts (structs, pointers, memory management, etc.)
